## Backpacking Gear Checklist

This is a lot of stuff; a lot of it is optional, a bunch of it you can borrow from me. As a general rule, don't bring anything that won't fit in your pack.

### Water

- [ ] Filter[^1]
- [ ] 1-2 liters of water

[^1]: If you don't already have a filter, buy a [Sawyer Squeeze](https://www.amazon.com/Sawyer-Products-SP131-PointOne-Squeeze/dp/B00B1OSU4W/ref=sr_1_3?crid=35AOY9S2NGCNG&dchild=1&keywords=sawyer%2Bsqueeze&qid=1596637182&sprefix=sawyer%2Bsqe%2Caps%2C300&sr=8-3&th=1) right now. [Smart Water](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/311Rq172AML.jpg) bottles are tough as nails, easy to fill, and work super well with the squeeze.

### Food

- [ ] Instant coffee
- [ ] Salty snacks
- [ ] Sweet snacks
- [ ] Dehydrated Fruit
- [ ] Dehydrated Meals[^2]
